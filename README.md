###About
-------
A company may wish to reimburse it's employees for a whole range of expenses in order to encourage certain behaviors. For example, a company could institute a policy of reimbursing employees for attending work-related seminars or refreshing their skills with specific training and certifications. The TRMS provides a structured system for a company to keep track of these reimbursements and replace error-prone analogue and email-based systems. The stored records may also be accessed for data analytics to discover employee trends and possible points of optimization in the company's reimbursement program.
